The system supports multi-language user interfaces, with a specific focus on English and Dutch. Users can switch between these languages within the main application, while sub-apps and their launchers require qualified programmers for both addition and deletion. The system boasts customization capabilities allowing changes to colors, fonts, icons, buttons, backgrounds, and text elements across sub-apps and the main application, excluding external components.
The main menu showcases launchers for various apps, including Map, News, Agenda, Facebook, Twitter, Employee Finder, Encyclopedia, and Student Handbook, with some launchers conditionally displayed based on language settings. Social media integration is robust, enabling users to like, tweet, and manage settings for Twitter and Facebook directly from the main menu.
Navigation and map functionalities are extensive. The system supports searches for buildings, POIs, and routes within the TU/e campus. Users can navigate between these locations with different transportation modes and switch between stylistic and satellite map views. The system also displays routes planned by the navigator and current user location on the map.
Administration features allow administrators to modify the stylistic map, manage buildings, paths, and POIs, ensuring the system remains up-to-date and accurate. News and event management functionalities include displaying news items, upcoming events, and allowing users to interact with these items through likes and tweets. The employee finder functionality enables users to search for employees by name or department, view personal information, and locate employee offices on the map, further enhancing navigational ease.
The system emphasizes ease of use, accessibility, and customization, ensuring a user-friendly interface. Security measures include restricting language selection to the main application and managing social media credentials securely. The system ensures reliability and maintainability by requiring qualified programmers for critical operations and providing extensive administrative control.
Performance requirements highlight the system's ability to handle real-time searches, navigation, and social media interactions efficiently. Scalability is ensured through modular design, allowing easy addition and deletion of sub-apps and launchers.
In summary, the SRS document presents a detailed blueprint of the system, outlining its multi-language support, extensive customization, robust navigation and map functionalities, social media integration, and comprehensive administrative control. These elements collectively ensure a user-friendly, secure, and efficient system tailored to meet diverse user needs.
