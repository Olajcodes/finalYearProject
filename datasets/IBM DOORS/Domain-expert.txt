Functional Requirements
Project Initialization and Configuration
Users can create new RMF projects or convert existing DOORS projects.

Projects use a configurable data model with reusable templates and module types.
Module Management
Users can create, tag, and synchronize RMF modules based on templates like UR (User Requirements), SR (System Requirements), IVV (Integration/Verification/Validation), etc.
Document and Database View
The tool allows switching between document-style and database-style views for the same module.
Traceability and Linking
Enables creation of traceability links (e.g. “satisfies”, “verifies”) between different module types to ensure requirement relationships.
Requirement Analysis
Provides views for analysis like key requirement list, risk analysis, and compliance matrices.
Risk and Key Requirements Management
Users can tag critical and key requirements using specific attributes and analyze them using visual tools.
Issues and Decisions Tracking
Users can track issues and decisions through IDJ modules linked to relevant requirements.
IVV Management
Requirements must be linked to at least one test procedure (Validation, Verification, or Integration).
Each test procedure includes attributes like method, responsible person, event, and approval level.
Integrity Checking
Includes tools to check data consistency and rule compliance at project and module levels.
Users can define and run custom integrity rules using DXL scripting.
Exchange and Document Generation
Supports Word-based documentation generation and controlled data import/export.
Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability and Customization
The data model is adaptable for small and large projects and can be modified over time.
Multiple modules of the same type can exist within a single project.
Access Control
The “Config” folder and critical project areas must be protected by access rights to prevent accidental changes.
Performance and Usability
Tools like Explorer and default linkset pairing improve navigation and minimize user errors.
Visual indicators and matrix views help users quickly understand requirement relationships.
Maintainability
Predefined templates and rule libraries simplify project maintenance and evolution.
Modular structure allows independent updates and customization of parts of the system.
Traceability and Consistency
All changes and links must align with the predefined RMF data model for consistency.
System highlights misaligned or broken links and provides tools to fix them.
Audit and History
Integrity checks generate reports and log files that can be stored for future reference.
PUID (Project Unique Identifier) ensures stable and unique identification of requirements.
