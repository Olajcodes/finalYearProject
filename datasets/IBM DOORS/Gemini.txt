The IBM Rational DOORS Requirements Management Framework Add-on (IRDRMFAO) is a solution designed to enhance DOORS by incorporating processes, data models, and utilities that align with EIA632, ISO 15288, and CMMI standards. IRDRMFAO introduces a generic data model that includes module types and relationships, allowing users to customize their projects. This model supports impact analysis and traceability through bottom-up oriented links between module types, which can be added even without write access to higher-level modules.   
IRDRMFAO allows users to switch between document and database views of the same module. The document view is suited for a global, linear display of structured information, while the database view is used for analyzing information with attributes and displaying traceability matrices.   
To create an IRDRMFAO project, users need DOORS and IRDRMFAO installed, a DOORS database with defined users and access rights, and familiarity with DOORS. The process involves running DOORS, having the necessary permissions, and using the RMF menu to create a new project, which includes naming the project, selecting a data model, and configuring project settings.   
The system also provides tools for project configuration, including settings for PUID, WORD, RCM, PFM, DOC, EXCHANGE, CHECK, and VISIBILITY. These configurations help manage various aspects of the project, such as document generation, requirement consistency, and data exchange.   
For managing requirements, IRDRMFAO supports the characterization of requirements, definition of issues and decisions, and identification of risks and key requirements. It also enables linking RMF objects and checking data consistency through tools like the Project and Module Consistency Check and Integrity Check.   
The system includes predefined integrity rules and allows for user-defined rules to ensure data accuracy. It also provides enhanced Word exporting capabilities and tools for adapting project profiles, including adding or modifying object types, templates, module types, and relationships.
