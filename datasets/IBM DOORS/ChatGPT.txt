The IBM Rational DOORS Requirements Management Framework Add-on (IRDRMFAO) is a comprehensive extension of IBM Rational DOORS, tailored to enhance the requirements engineering process by aligning with internationally recognized standards such as EIA632, ISO 15288, and CMMI. The add-on serves as a methodological layer that introduces structured processes, a reusable data model, and utility tools without disrupting the core functionality and layout of DOORS itself. This seamless integration allows users to retain access to native DOORS features while leveraging additional capabilities for improved requirement management.
At the heart of IRDRMFAO lies its generic data model, which provides a foundational structure consisting of various module types (templates) and inter-module relationships. These templates represent different aspects of system development, such as user requirements, system requirements, subsystem requirements, verification procedures, validation and installation procedures, operational concepts, and interface specifications. This modularity ensures flexibility, allowing project teams to construct tailored data models that reflect the specific structure and complexity of their projects.
The framework supports a project-centric organization, enabling users to standardize their requirement models across multiple projects based on a consistent product breakdown structure (PBS). The relationships defined within the model—such as “satisfies,” “verifies,” and “is allocated by”—facilitate traceability and ensure logical connectivity between different levels of requirements and supporting components. These relationships are critical for mapping user expectations to system functionalities and verifying that system outputs meet intended purposes.
Additionally, IRDRMFAO incorporates tools for requirements analysis and decision documentation, allowing users to track issues and record decisions made during the analysis phase. This feature ensures transparency and provides a historical reference that supports compliance and accountability. The framework also emphasizes integration with verification and validation (IVV) processes, aligning testing procedures with specific requirements to confirm that the system behaves as expected.
Overall, the IRDRMFAO promotes a disciplined approach to requirement management by combining structure, traceability, and flexibility. Its architecture empowers teams to define and control project requirements with clarity while supporting compliance with engineering standards. Through its layered model and reusable components, the framework serves as a scalable solution that enhances the reliability and quality of complex system development projects.
