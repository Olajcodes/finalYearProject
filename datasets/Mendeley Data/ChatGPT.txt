The functional requirements of the system define its core capabilities and expected behaviors to ensure a seamless user experience. First, the system must support multilingual functionality, allowing all text elements in the user interface to be presented in the selected language. It is explicitly required to support both English and Dutch as available languages.
Additionally, the system must enable the management of sub-applications within the main application. Specifically, sub-apps and their launchers should be added or deleted by a qualified programmer, ensuring controlled modifications within the software environment.
Customization is another essential aspect of the system’s functionality. Users should be able to modify various visual elements within the user interface of both the main application and its sub-apps. These elements include colors, fonts, icons, buttons, and backgrounds. However, such modifications must be limited to internal resources, excluding any externally sourced content.
Overall, these functional requirements ensure that the system remains adaptable, user-friendly, and manageable, while providing essential customization features to enhance usability and maintainability
