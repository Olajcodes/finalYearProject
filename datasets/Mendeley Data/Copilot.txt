The comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document delineates various functional requirements critical to the system's design and functionality. Central to these requirements is the system's language flexibility, necessitating that all text elements in user interfaces be presented in the selected language. This includes explicit support for English and Dutch as user interface languages, with language selection restricted to the main application, and the default language set to English. This ensures a localized user experience while maintaining a default setting for broader accessibility.
In terms of modularity, the document outlines the inclusion and management of sub-applications. It mandates that sub-apps and their launchers be added or deleted by qualified programmers, ensuring controlled and secure integration or removal of components. This separation of duties underscores the importance of maintaining the system's integrity through proper authorization.
Customization emerges as a pivotal feature, with the system capable of altering visual elements across the user interface. This includes changing colors, fonts, icons, buttons, background, and text elements, albeit with external elements excluded. Such extensive customization options allow for a tailored user experience, enabling the interface to adapt to varied user preferences and branding guidelines.
The main menu serves as a hub for various applications, with functional requirements detailing the presence of specific app launchers. These include the Map-app, News-app, Agenda-app, Facebook-app, Twitter-app, and Employee-finder-app. additionally, conditional display of launchers for the Encyclopedia-app and Student handbook-app, based on the language selection, highlights the system's dynamic adaptability to user preferences.
The system's integration with social media platforms is meticulously specified. Users can like and tweet about inscriptions directly from the main menu, and dedicated settings menus for Twitter and Facebook allow for the management of user credentials. The ability to save and delete usernames and passwords ensures that users have control over their social media interactions within the application.
Navigation and spatial functionality form a significant part of the requirements. The system is equipped to handle searches for buildings and points-of-interest (POIs) on the TU/e campus by name or address. It must display matching search results and facilitate navigation between buildings and POIs, with the capability to switch between different means of transportation. The system's map view features stylistic and satellite options, supporting zoom, pan, and displaying routes planned by the navigator. Users' current locations and POIs must be shown, and social media integration extends to tweeting locations and updating Facebook statuses.
Administrative functionalities are robust, allowing administrators to modify the stylistic map, manage buildings, and edit paths used in the route planner. This includes adding or removing vertices, edges, and POIs, and linking or unlinking POIs to specific locations. Such comprehensive administrative control ensures the system remains up-to-date and accurate.
News and event management are also detailed, with the system showing news titles, article previews, and full reports based on user selection. Users can like and tweet news items, and administrators can modify English and Dutch news RSS feeds. The agenda app features a calendar view, event search by date or subject, and social media interactions for events.
Employee finder functionality allows users to search for employees by name or department, view personal information, and locate employees' offices on the map. Planning routes to these locations is integrated, enhancing navigational ease.
In summary, the SRS document provides an intricate blueprint of functional requirements, ensuring the system's language adaptability, customization, modularity, social media integration, navigation capabilities, administrative control, news and event management, and employee search functionalities. Each requirement is meticulously designed to offer a seamless, user-centric experience, aligning with the overarching goal of creating a robust, flexible, and intuitive system.
