# ðŸ“„ Abstractive Summarization of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

## ðŸ§  Abstract
The complexity and verbosity of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents pose a major challenge to stakeholders. While essential for guiding system design and implementation, these documents are often hard to digest quickly, resulting in miscommunication and project delays.

This study evaluates six summarization agents â€” ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, LDA, BERT, and a domain expert â€” on two SRS datasets (IBM DOORS and Mendeley). Using cosine similarity, verbosity metrics, and visualization tools, the project assesses the balance between semantic retention and output conciseness. Results show that generative AI models, especially Gemini and ChatGPT, outperform traditional methods and offer scalable summarization solutions.

The study proposes a hybrid summarization approach: leveraging generative AI for initial summarization followed by expert refinement for domain accuracy.
